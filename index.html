    <p>Welcome to <strong>Wedding Photo Generator: Wed AI</strong>! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the <strong>Wedding Photo Generator: Wed AI</strong> mobile application (the "App") provided by <strong>Hamza Canbaz</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"). By downloading, installing or using the App you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
    <p><strong>Wedding Photo Generator: Wed AI</strong> is an AI-powered service that creates professional wedding photos, bridal try-ons, animated moments, and headshots from your photos. You must be at least 17 years old to use the App. You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. AI-Generated Content Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> All images and videos generated by the App are created using artificial intelligence technology. While we strive for high quality results, AI-generated content may contain:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inaccuracies or artifacts in facial features, backgrounds, or details</li>
        <li>Unexpected variations from the original photo</li>
        <li>Inconsistencies in style, lighting, or composition</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Not for Official Use:</strong> AI-generated images are intended for personal, creative, and non-critical professional use only. They should not be used for government-issued documents, official identification, legal purposes, or any context requiring verified, unaltered photographs.</p>
    <p><strong>No Guarantees:</strong> We do not guarantee specific results, quality, or accuracy of generated content. Results may vary based on input photos, selected styles, and AI model performance.</p>

    <h2>3. Accounts and Data</h2>
    <p>The App requires an account to access features. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.</p>
    <p>By using the App, you consent to our collection and processing of information as described in our Privacy Policy. Photos you upload are processed by our AI service and may be temporarily stored to generate your output.</p>
    <p><strong>Photo Privacy:</strong> Your uploaded photos are used solely for generating AI content. We do not sell your photos to third parties. See our Privacy Policy for complete details on data handling.</p>

    <h2>4. User Content (Uploaded Photos)</h2>
    <p>When you upload photos to the App, you retain ownership of those photos. By uploading photos, you represent and warrant that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You own the photos or have the right to use them</li>
        <li>The photos do not infringe on anyone else's rights</li>
        <li>The photos do not violate these Terms or applicable laws</li>
        <li>You have obtained consent from any individuals appearing in the photos</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, process, and store your uploaded photos for the purpose of generating AI content and operating the App.</p>

    <h2>5. AI-Generated Images & Usage Rights</h2>

        <li>Impersonate others or misrepresent identity</li>
        <li>Generate deepfakes or malicious content</li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Attribution:</strong> While not required, we appreciate if you credit "Wedding Photo Generator: Wed AI" when sharing AI-generated images publicly.</p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All rights, title and interest in and to the App (including its design, code, AI models, algorithms, text and other content) are owned by us or our licensors.

    <p>The <strong>Wedding Photo Generator: Wed AI</strong> name, logo, and branding are our trademarks and may not be used without permission.</p>

    <h2>7. Credits & Purchases</h2>
    <p>The App uses a credit-based system. Each generation consumes credits (typically 10 credits per image). Credits can be purchased through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One-time credit packages</li>
        <li>Subscription plans with recurring credits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Purchases are processed through Apple's App Store and are subject to Apple's terms. Subscription payments will be charged to your Apple ID at the time of purchase and will renew automatically unless canceled via your App Store account settings at least 24 hours before the renewal date.</p>
    <p><strong>No Refunds:</strong> Credits are consumed immediately upon generation. We do not offer refunds for consumed credits or if you are unsatisfied with AI-generated results. Unused credits do not expire unless explicitly stated (e.g., subscription credits may roll over depending on the plan terms).</p>
    <p><strong>Free Trial:</strong> Some subscription plans may offer a free trial period. You will be charged when the trial ends unless you cancel before the trial period expires.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated Terms in the App and update the Effective Date above. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms. Material changes will be notified through the App or via email.</p>
